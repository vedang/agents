## Lessons

- When adding or importing a new skill under `skills/`, update the README configuration map in the same pass so discoverability stays current.
- When a prompt overlaps a skill’s domain, prefer making the prompt a thin delegator to the skill’s canonical templates/workflow instead of maintaining two independent instruction specs.
