## Lessons

- Code maps are ideal for visualizing systems with clear component relationships (extensions, pipelines, architectures)
- Simulation controls help users understand conditional logic by letting them "play through" different scenarios
- Natural language prompts should only mention non-default values and provide enough context to be actionable without seeing the UI
