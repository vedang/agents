description: Build an interactive website to better understand the code
---

Build an interactive HTML/CSS/JS website in the `.agents/explainers/<short-name>` folder. Explain: $@

Select an appropriate short-name for the website, based on the user's question.

Always add support for light/dark/system mode and render the system mode. This need not be an explicit toggle on the page, it should just respect the user's system preferences.
